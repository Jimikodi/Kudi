How to Upgrade

Go to Settings and go to Jimi's Help,
Then click on update and update would start. But if you need to switch to a new build, you will need to do Fresh start. You can find Fresh Start in Setting and in Jimi's Help. After Fresh Start you will need to unplug from outlet and TV, then reconnect to the outlet and TV. When back in Kodi go Setting then go to file manager
Go to programs and click on it. Then click on ADD SOURCE. Then enter file source.

Then locate jimikodi on the next screen and click on it. Then click on jimikodi@gmail.com 2.0.0. You should see it enabled on the bottom right corner after a couple of seconds. Then go back to the main screen and click on programs and then program add ons. Click on jimikodi and choose either Future, Shadow, DarkFuture, and DarkShadow (Darkshadow and DarkFuture are builds with Adult content) let it download then follow the on screen text and click YES for all of it. After unplug then plug it back and then back to kodi.
If you install any of the builds with adult content you would have to go to System and then to Switch Profile to get adult content. Do the same to switch back to the normal settings.
